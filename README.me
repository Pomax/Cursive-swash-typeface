I'm designing a cursive, swashed typeface, and will try to implement it as OpenType font.

We'll see how it goes; it'll require mad ligature substitution, as well as contextual subtitutions.

I'll be scanning in sheets to get most of the face properties documented, and will be writing a up design doc for it.
